# PubgDataSc
I have analysed the Pubg Dataset somewhat in this repository and will upload furthe according to the changes that will be made afterwards
as I will understand the dataset more.
In a Pubg Game, upto 100 players play at a time in a match and 60 in lite, although this one is for Official Pubg.
Players can play solo as well as in duo and squad. During game, players can pick different weapons and heals etc.
They get revived after they are knocked down. There is a long list for things that are done.

The team at PUBG has made official game data available for the public to expolore and scavenge outside.
The analysis done here is based on the data collected by Kaggle and made official through the PUBG developer API.
Here we will go through diiferent outliners and visualize the data through charts.

This is being made on Google Collab and you can run this through any notebook too. I prefer Collab.
The data is provided on Kaggle as already told. Firstly you will need to upload the csv files and mount your 
drive if using Google Collab.

Enjoy exploring PUBG....
